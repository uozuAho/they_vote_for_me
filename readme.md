# They vote for me

Experiments using [they vote for you's API](https://theyvoteforyou.org.au/help/data)

# todo
- feature: click on histogram section: show individuals within that section
    - order by electorate
    - add link to TVFY person details page
        - do via search, since API data doesn't contain link
    - person API is lacking
        - can't show current/former status
        - can't link to person page
- docs within UI
    - what the chart numbers mean
    - how the chart values are calculated
    - note that 'on the voices' votes are more common than divisions. These
        don't get recorded
- deploy
