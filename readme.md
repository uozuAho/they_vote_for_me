# They vote for me

Experiments using [they vote for you's API](https://theyvoteforyou.org.au/help/data)

# todo
- show all parties
    - group small parties in 'other'?
- make user friendly
    - add docs & links to UI
        - note that 'on the voices' votes are more common than divisions. These
          don't get recorded
    - urls make sense
- deploy
